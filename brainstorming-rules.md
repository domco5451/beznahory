# Brainstorming Rules

## Greetings!
At the start of brainstorming we say: Lets brainstorm!

## Defer Judgment 
Creative spaces are judgment-free zones—they let ideas flow so people can build from each other's great ideas.

## Encourage Wild Ideas
Embrace the most out-of-the-box notions. There’s often not a whole lot of difference between outrageous and brilliant.

## Build on the Ideas of Others
Try to use “and” instead of “but," it encourages positivity and inclusivity and leads to tons of ideas.

## Stay Focused on the Topic
Try to keep the discussion on target. Divergence is good, but you still need to keep your eyes on the prize.

## One Conversation at a Time
This can be difficult—especially with lots of creative people in a single room—but always think about the challenge topic and how to stay on track.

## Be Visual
Use colored markers and Post-its. Stick your ideas on the wall so others can visualize them.

## Go for Quantity
Crank your ideas out quickly. For any 60-minute session, you should try to generate 100 ideas.
